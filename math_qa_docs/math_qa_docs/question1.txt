Question:
What is the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7?

Step-by-step solution:
1. Recall the power rule: d/dx[x^n] = n*x^(n-1).
2. Differentiate each term separately:
   - d/dx[x^3] = 3x^2
   - d/dx[2x^2] = 2 * 2x = 4x
   - d/dx[-5x] = -5
   - d/dx[7] = 0
3. Combine the derivatives:
   f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5
