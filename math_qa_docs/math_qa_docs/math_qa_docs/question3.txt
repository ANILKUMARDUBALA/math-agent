Question:
What is the integral of f(x) = 2x with respect to x?

Step-by-step solution:
1. Recall the integral formula: ∫ x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.
2. For f(x) = 2x, rewrite as 2 * x^1.
3. Integrate:
   ∫ 2x dx = 2 * ∫ x dx = 2 * (x^2 / 2) + C = x^2 + C.
4. Therefore, the integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2 + C.
