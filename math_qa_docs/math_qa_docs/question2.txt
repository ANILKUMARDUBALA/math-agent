Question:
Solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.

Step-by-step solution:
1. The quadratic equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, here a=1, b=-5, c=6.
2. Compute the discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4*1*6 = 25 - 24 = 1.
3. Since D > 0, there are two real roots:
   x = [-b Â± sqrt(D)] / (2a)
4. Calculate the roots:
   x1 = (5 + 1)/2 = 6/2 = 3
   x2 = (5 - 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2
5. Solutions are x = 3 and x = 2.
